# simple_x11_tiling_wm

Not functional right now
<br><br>
This is a continuation of my previous project [learning_x11_wm](https://github.com/RockRottenSalad/learning_x11_wm)
where I had made a very simple X11 window manager in an attempt to learn how to work with X11. This is a retake
on that simple project with an attempt to make yet another simple window manager, using the things I learned
last time.
